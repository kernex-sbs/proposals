# kernex.sbs · proposals

> Systems-first project proposals for hackathons, research, and experimental infrastructure.

This repository contains **carefully thought-out project proposals** developed under **kernex.sbs**.
Each proposal exists *before code* — focused on problem clarity, system design, and execution feasibility.

---

## Why this repository exists

Most hackathon projects fail not because of bad code, but because of:

* weak problem framing
* rushed planning
* unclear scope
* no execution strategy

This repo fixes that.

> **Ideas live here first. Code comes later.**

---

## What you’ll find here

* Hackathon-ready proposals
* System and architecture-focused designs
* Experimental and research-oriented ideas
* Low-level and infrastructure concepts
* Proposals that may evolve into real products or repos

## Proposal Standards

Each proposal should aim to answer:

* What problem is being solved?
* Why does this problem matter?
* What is the core insight?
* How does the system work?
* What data is involved and who owns it?
* What is realistically achievable within constraints?

Perfection is not required. **Clarity is.**

---

## Philosophy

> Ideas are cheap.
> **Well-structured ideas are not.**

This repository values:

* thinking before building
* systems over features
* execution-aware design
* long-term learning over short-term hype

---

## Current Proposals

* **HackathonOS**
  Intelligent hackathon discovery and calendar-aware execution planning.

---

## Maintainer

**kernex.sbs**
Building systems. Breaking assumptions. Shipping ideas.
